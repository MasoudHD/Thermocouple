# Thermocouple

Convert the voltage of different types of thermocouples to accurate temperature by using polynomial equations and considering cold junction temperature.

By using this C library you can calculate the accurate temperature of a thermocouple (TC). Using this library is easy; however, you can find a simple example in the main.c file.

I have used the following website as my reference:

For more information about how to use this library you can watch this video:

## Notice!!!

This is an open-source library, and I can not guarantee that it is bug-free and operate without any problem, so be careful about using this library in sensitive applications and double-check its performance.
